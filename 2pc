binary decision. why?

2pc:
agreement: coordinator made the decision
validity: decision is not trivial
termination: no loop


crash & failur!!
phase1 + coordinator:

**coordinator crashed. participants are blocked, waiting for 'coordinator' to start phase 2
very bad.

both coordinator and one participant failed:
     is failed participant 1 or 0? 2nd coordinator doesn't know.
