problem with 2pc:
if coordinator and one participant crashed:
   origin value of participant unknown -> can't decide & commit
   that participant might have commited already -> can't abort.
!!!

non-transparent information & immature commit -> can't recover

:broadcast the final decision before any commit.


problem left: multiple coordinator caused by network partition
